    " Teaching lessons 3.12 Calling Procedures and 3.13 Developing Procedures helped me better understand how procedures make programs more organized and efficient. While teaching, I reinforced the difference between defining and calling a procedure and saw how parameters allow data to be passed and reused in different parts of a program. I also learned how important abstraction is for simplifying complex code and making it easier to read. By explaining these concepts to others, I realized how modular design and clear procedure names make problem-solving more manageable.

    "### What I learned:\n",
    " The Food Route helped me think critically about how to teach READ operations in databases using a fun, real-world context. I designed interactive examples like Korean BBQ queries, street taco filtering, and In-N-Out pagination to make SQL concepts engaging and practical. Building the lesson reinforced my understanding of SELECT statements, WHERE clauses, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and pattern matching, and it challenged me to explain these ideas clearly for others. Overall, developing this module strengthened both my technical SQL skills and my ability to translate complex coding concepts into an interactive experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I worked on:\n",
    "\n",
    "While creating the **Quest Chapter: The Food Route**, I developed the **progress check and quick quizzes** to help learners reinforce what they were learning. I designed them to align with each section, like SELECT queries for Korean BBQ, WHERE filtering for street tacos, and pagination for In-N-Out Burger. Working on these quizzes helped me think about **how students process SQL concepts**, the quizzes were short questions that would help reinforce the topic with **immediate feedback** to strengthen understanding. Including these checks made the lesson more interactive and ensured that learners could **apply concepts at each stage**. The progress check was just to help them keep track of what they finished.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Add More Interactivity**  \n",

    "   - Include diagrams linking SQL concepts (like JOINs or WHERE filters) to the food examples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Make it more easy to understand for Beginners**  \n",
    "   - Provide **step-by-step examples** before asking learners to write queries independently.  \n",
    "   - Add hints or tooltips explaining clauses like ORDER BY, LIMIT, or LIKE.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Expand Context or Scenarios**  \n",
    "   - Include more diverse dishes, cities, or real-world filtering scenarios.  \n",
    "   - Add mini “challenges” comparing price ranges, cuisine types, or nutritional info.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Enhance Quizzes and Reflection**  \n",
    "   - Include more **interactive questions** with instant feedback.  \n",
    "   - Add reflective prompts, like “How would you find the cheapest premium dish?”  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Performance Notes**  \n",

    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> option B, because in that one yPos decreases by 2, making the circles move down and to the right instead. That gives the correct centers of (3, 6), (5, 4), and (7, 2), which matches the figure.</p>\n",

    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> C, because every device connected to the Internet is assigned an Internet Protocol (IP) address. This address identifies the device and allows it to send and receive data across networks. It’s like a digital “home address” for communication on the Internet.</p>\n",

    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> D, because downloading the album from a licensed online music seller is legal. Since it’s not an illegal download, this action would not violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).</p>\n",

    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I left this question blank.</span></p>\n",

    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I left this question blank.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> A, because an archive of previous versions of the e-book is not typically part of metadata. Metadata usually contains information that helps identify and categorize the book, like the author and title (B), the publication date (C), and the genre (D).</p>\n",

    "<p>Line 1: Move X Times with X = 2 moves the robot 2 squares forward (to the right).</p>\n",

    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I left this question blank.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> B, because in that configuration there is only one path from computer P to computer S: P → R → Q → S. There is no alternative route, so redundant routing between P and S is not possible. The other configurations (A, C, and D) all have multiple paths connecting P and S, allowing for redundant routing if one connection fails.</p>\n",

    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I left this question blank.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> C, because byte pair encoding is a lossless transformation. Even though it replaces repeated character pairs with single characters, the encoding algorithm saves a mapping of replacements. This mapping allows the original string to be fully reconstructed from the encoded string, so no data is lost.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"color:blue;\"><strong>25-Shortening strings by replacing TH and IS</strong></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I answered C, but that was incorrect.</span> The string MEET_ME_LATER actually can be shortened using byte pair encoding because it contains repeated pairs, like “ME,” which can be replaced to make the string shorter.</p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> B, because LEVEL_UP does not have any repeated pairs of characters. Byte pair encoding only works when pairs appear more than once, so this string cannot be shortened using that method.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"color:blue;\"><strong>27-Guessing a secret number</strong></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I answered C, but that was incorrect.</span> If I set win ← true between lines 20 and 21, it would run after an incorrect guess, causing the loop to terminate even when the guess is wrong.</p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct place to insert:</span> win ← true is between lines 9 and 10, right after displaying “You got it right!” This way, the loop only ends when the user actually guesses the secret number.</p>\n",

    "<p style=\"color:blue;\"><strong>28-Text-editing application with binary sequences</strong></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I left this question blank.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> C.</p>\n",
    "<p>Explanation: To assign a unique binary sequence to each character, the number of possible sequences must be at least 200. Each bit doubles the number of sequences:</p>\n",
    "<p>7 bits → 2⁷ = 128 (too few)</p>\n",

    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I answered C, but that was incorrect.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> A, here’s why:</p>\n",
    "<p>For C: A = false, B = false → AND gate output = false</p>\n",
    "<p>C = true, D = true → OR gate output = true</p>\n",
    "<p>The second OR gate receives false and true → output = true</p>\n",

    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I left this question blank.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> B, because Program I does not correctly move the robot to the gray square; it repeats a fixed sequence of moves that doesn’t account for the robot’s starting position. Program II, however, uses a loop that repeats until the robot reaches the gray square and checks whether it can move forward or needs to rotate, ensuring the robot successfully reaches the goal.</p>\n",

    "<p style=\"color:blue;\"><strong>33-Apartment rental Web site flowchart</strong></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I left this question blank.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> A, because the flowchart sets include to true if either the apartment is on a floor greater than 10 or it has 3 bedrooms. This corresponds to the logical OR statement: include ← (floor > 10) OR (bedrooms = 3).</p>\n",
    "\n",

    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I answered B, but that was incorrect.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> C, because both code segments display the correct average. The difference is that Program I calculates the average inside the loop for each number in the list, performing the division multiple times, while Program II calculates the average once after summing all numbers, making it more efficient.</p>\n",

    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> A, because open standards and protocols ensure that hardware and software from different manufacturers and developers can communicate with each other over the Internet. This interoperability is a key benefit, allowing devices and applications to work together seamlessly.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"color:blue;\"><strong>41-Computer science midterm and final with MAX</strong></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I answered A, but that was incorrect.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> C, because adjustedTotal ← Max(midtermExam, finalExam) + finalExam correctly calculates the total points according to the score replacement policy. Option A only assigns the larger of the two scores to adjustedTotal, which ignores the final exam score in the total points calculation.</p>\n",

    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I answered B, but that was incorrect.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> A, because the number of steps grows as a polynomial function of n (specifically, roughly n²). Polynomial-time algorithms are considered to run in reasonable time even for large input sizes, unlike exponential-time algorithms, which quickly become impractical.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"color:blue;\"><strong>44-Using a 4 bit representation for integers</strong></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I answered C, but that was incorrect.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> B, because with 4 bits, the maximum nonnegative integer that can be represented is 15.</p>\n",
    "<p>4 + 8 = 12 → does not overflow.</p>\n",
    "<p>7 + 10 = 17 → overflow, since 17 > 15.</p>\n",
    "<p>12 + 3 = 15 → does not overflow, because 15 is within the 4-bit limit.</p>\n",

    "<p style=\"color:blue;\"><strong>45-NAND logic gate</strong></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I left this question blank.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> C, because a NAND gate outputs false only when both inputs are true. This behavior is modeled by the Boolean expression NOT (P AND Q), which inverts the result of an AND gate.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"color:blue;\"><strong>48-Science experiment with 75 percent successful trials</strong></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I left this question blank.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> D, because 75% of trials are expected to be successful. Using RANDOM(1, 100) <= 75 ensures that, on average, 75 out of 100 random numbers will satisfy the condition and increment the successful count, while the remaining 25% will increment the unsuccessful count.</p>\n",

    "<p style=\"color:blue;\"><strong>49-Completing code to display multiples of 5</strong></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I answered B, but that was incorrect.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> C, because the loop needs to iterate once for each multiple of 5 between start and end, inclusive. Using ((end − start) ÷ 5) + 1 gives the correct number of iterations. For example, if start = 35 and end = 50, this evaluates to ((50 − 35) ÷ 5) + 1 = 4, so the loop displays 35, 40, 45, and 50.</p>\n",

    "<p style=\"color:blue;\"><strong>52-Algorithms to identify palindrome words in list</strong></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I left this question blank.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> B, because the algorithm must first keep palindromes, then shorten each word to its first letter, and finally sort the resulting list alphabetically. Doing the steps in any other order would either remove necessary information too early or sort the wrong data.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"color:blue;\"><strong>54-Abstraction with procedures Square and Cube</strong></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I answered B, but that was incorrect.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> D, because the Power(n, m) procedure generalizes the functionality of Square and Cube by allowing any exponent m. Square is just Power(n, 2) and Cube is Power(n, 3), so Power captures the behavior of both procedures and more.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"color:blue;\"><strong>55-Results of the KeepPlaying procedure</strong></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I left this question blank.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> D, because the condition on line 5 checks whether the response is both \"y\" and \"yes\" at the same time. Since a user’s input can never equal both \"y\" and \"yes\" simultaneously, the condition is always false, and the procedure always returns false.</p>\n",

    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I answered C, but that was incorrect.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> A, because statements I and II are true: the Internet provides participants access to tools, information, and professional knowledge, and it lowers geographic barriers so people from different locations can contribute. Statement III is false because not all computational problems can be solved in reasonable time, even with crowdsourcing or distributed approaches.</p>\n",

    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I answered C, but that was incorrect.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answer:</span> B, because using lossy compression reduces file size by discarding some data, which prevents the studio from accessing full-quality videos in the future. The other options support archival goals by ensuring compatibility, expandability, and reliability.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"color:blue;\"><strong>60-Managing complexity with abstraction</strong></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I left this question blank.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answers:</span> A and D. Abstraction helps manage program complexity by replacing repeated code with a procedure (A), so the programmer doesn’t have to rewrite the same logic multiple times, and by grouping related variables into a single data structure like a list (D), which simplifies handling multiple values. Options B and C do not reduce program complexity; they only affect readability or typing convenience.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"color:blue;\"><strong>61-Data about students at East and West High schools</strong></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I left this question blank.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answers:</span> A and B. The schools can create a single list of student names sorted by last name (A) because both data sets include first and last names. They can also calculate the average number of days students are absent (B) because both data sets include the days absent. They cannot determine which ZIP code is represented by the most students (C) because West High School’s data does not include ZIP codes.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"color:blue;\"><strong>62-Compare online encyclopedia with paper encyclopedia</strong></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I answered only B, but that was incorrect.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answers:</span> C and D, because a free online encyclopedia can reflect a larger number of perspectives (C) since many users can contribute, and it can be quickly updated (D) as new information becomes available. Option B is incorrect because the content can change over time, so it is not guaranteed to be the same every time it is accessed.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"color:blue;\"><strong>63-Use of isPrime procedure</strong></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I answered A and B, but that was partially incorrect.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct lines to remove:</span> B and D. Line 4 resets count to 0 inside the loop, which prevents the program from keeping a running total, and line 9 incorrectly adds 1 to count for every number, even non-primes. Keeping line 1 ensures count starts at 0 before the loop begins, which is necessary.</p>\n",

    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I left this question blank.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answers:</span> B and C, because cloud computing enhances collaboration (B) by allowing multiple users to access and work on shared resources simultaneously, and it introduces new data-security concerns (C) since data is stored on external servers that may be vulnerable to breaches. Options A and D are incorrect because redundancy is still necessary for reliability, and cloud computing does not reduce intellectual property concerns.</p>\n",

    "<p style=\"color:blue;\"><strong>65-Correcting errors in procedure Multiply</strong></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:red;\">I left this question blank.</span></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color:green;\">The correct answers:</span> B and D. The procedure only adds x to result a number of times equal to y, which works when y is positive. If y is negative (as in B or D), the loop condition count = y will never be met, so the procedure will not return the correct product. It works correctly when both x and y are positive or when x is negative and y is positive.</p>\n",

I want to learn how to structure projects so that each component interacts seamlessly with others, which will help me create more complex and polished programs. In addition, I want to learn how to make better games, including designing more interactive features, smoother mechanics, and engaging visuals that enhance the player experience. I’m interested in exploring techniques for game logic, character behaviors, and level design that make games more fun and challenging. I also want to practice debugging and testing my projects more thoroughly, so I can identify issues quickly and make my programs more reliable. By combining these skills, I hope to develop projects that are not only functional but also creative, immersive, and enjoyable for users.
