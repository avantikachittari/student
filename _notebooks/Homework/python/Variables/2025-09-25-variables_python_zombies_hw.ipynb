You‚Äôll define variables to store your name and age, reassign values, and answer interactive questions to test your understanding. This activity will help you master the basics of variables and how they work in programming."

    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create at least 8 variables** to describe a character or yourself.  \n",
    "   Examples:  \n",
    "   `name`, `age`, `favorite_food`, `hobby`, `number_of_pets`, `mood`, `favorite_color`, `dream_job`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assign initial values** to all variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reassign at least 4 of the variables** to new values to simulate changes over time or ‚Äúevents‚Äù in the story.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use **print statements** to write a story or profile that is **at least 5 sentences long**.  \n",
    "   Each sentence should include at least one variable.  \n",
    "   Example:  \n",
    "   > \"Tanay ('age' 17) loves pizza and plays tennis ('hobby') every weekend. Today, Tanay is happy because he ate his ('favoirite_food').\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Optional: Add **extra variables** to make your story longer and more creative.  \n",

    "  - Variable reassignment  \n",
    "  - Using variables in print statements\n",
