    "Making the About Page\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted my site to have a personal touch, so I created an About page that explains what the project is, why I‚Äôm making it, and a bit about myself. It‚Äôs simple but effective:\n",

    "Introduces me and what I‚Äôm working on\n",

    "Keeps the design clean so it matches the rest of the project\n",

    "It‚Äôs nice to have a spot where visitors can understand the purpose of everything in one place.\n",

    "Adding jokes.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "While working on the project, I thought it would be fun to sneak in some humor. That‚Äôs when I made a jokes.ipynb file. It‚Äôs just a Jupyter Notebook filled with some code-based jokes, playful outputs, and silly print statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one joke is about recursion‚Äîyou‚Äôll find it only if you keep scrolling üòè. Another is a math pun that appears when you run a cell. It makes coding feel a little lighter, and it‚Äôs a reminder that projects don‚Äôt always have to be serious to be meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding the About page was about clarity and communication. Adding jokes.ipynb was about fun and creativity. Together, they show that projects can balance professional structure with personal expression."
